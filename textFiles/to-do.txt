uses mongodb to grab data sometimes


TODO:

0.5. add react lol to the frontend file
1. try to understand how to add data into react using fetch [DONE]
2. try to make our git init point to the correct git url


Finished work:
------------------
1. I am now able to fetch from another server getting the json I needed from an api I made
2. To make this work first start the express server then start the react server.
