patches:
fixed the await bug where the server would get undefined data from the database if webscraping.
uses mongodb to grab data sometimes

Bugs-to-fix:
1. if the car age is old in mongoDB we run the data faster
2. If the car age is new in mongoDB we run the data a tad slower because we need to get the data
3. Now we need to fetch the data from mongoDB in our react app.



1. change your path file to webdraft5 for output.txt 
2. Send the data to the displayDataPage
3. If it does work then send the data to the front end

3. THEN WE DONE BOISSS!!
