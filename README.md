# License Plate Lookup Website

Welcome to the License Plate Lookup website! This project serves two primary purposes:

1. **Vehicle Information Lookup**: This website is designed to assist users in California in retrieving essential details about a vehicle simply by entering its license plate number. Whether you're curious about a car's make and model or need to verify ownership, our tool can help you access this information conveniently.

2. **Learning Resource for Aspiring Developers**: Are you a new programmer interested in exploring the realms of both backend and frontend development? Look no further! This project also serves as a valuable learning resource. By inspecting the codebase, you can gain insights into how to implement a frontend and backend website. It's a great opportunity to get familiar with the mechanics of building a functional web application from scratch.

Feel free to explore the code, experiment with the features, and enhance your skills in web development while also benefiting from the license plate lookup functionality.
